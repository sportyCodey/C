Some of my work in C

Before I get into the details, here's a quick run down of each folder posted:

Programs from the Advanced Operating Systems class: OS

Programs from the C and Unix class: C and Unix
******************************************************

I took one class on C and Unix and an Advanced Operating Systems class that used C. I haven't done any personal projects in C, but here are some class assignments that I have completed. I still code in C, however; as of now, I'm mainly reviewing the C language, the theory, and the syntax. 

Some of these programs are basic. The super easy ones demonstrate syntax and simple logic skills. Others demonstrate more advanced topics like structs, pointers, file I/O, command line arguments, MakeFile, threads, semaphores, and mutex locks. These programs are solutions to the problems in the textbooks our class were using at the time. 

All of these programs were created on Linux. I transferred the files to Windows by using WinSCP.
