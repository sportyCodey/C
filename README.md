# C
Some of my work in C

I took one class on C and Unix and an Advanced Operating Systems class that used C. I haven't done any personal projects in C, but here are some class assignments that I have completed. I still code in C, however; as of now, I'm mainly reviewing the C language, the theory, and the syntax. 

Some of these programs are basic. The super easy ones demonstrate syntax and simple logic skills. Others demonstrate more advanced topics like structs, pointers, file I/O, command line arguments, MakeFile, threads, semaphores, and mutex locks. These problems are a solution to the problems in the textbooks our class was using when I took the classes (class on C and Unix and class in Advanced Operating Systems) and problems from Programming in C Fourth Edition by Kochan. 

All of these programs were created on Linux. I transferred the files to Windows by using WinSCP.
