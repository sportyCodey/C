# C
Some of my C work

I took one class on C and Unix and an Advanced Operating Systems class that used C . I haven't done any personal projects in C, but here are some class assignments that I have completed. I still code in C, however; as of now, I'm mainly reviewing the C language, the theory, and the syntax. 

Most of these programs are basic. Some are super easy, but they demonstrate syntax and simple logic skills. Others demonstrate more advanced topics like structs, pointers, and MakeFile.
